# Build a FoodTracker Web Application

Now that there is a [FoodServer as a backend for the FoodTracker app](README.md), it becomes possible to start building a web application that also provides users with access to the stored Meal data.

The steps below show how to start hosting a web application for the images in the Kitura server.

### Serve the Meals using Static File Serving
One approach to making the Meals available through a web application is to store static HTML pages along with copies of the images on the local file system, and serve them using Kitura's StaticFileServer.

1. Update the Kitura server application to add a StaticFileServer  
   1. Open the `Sources/Application/Application.swift` source file that contains the REST API routes
   2. Setup the file handler to write to the web hosting directory by adding the following under the mealStore declaration:
    ```swift
    private var fileManager = FileManager.default
    private var rootPath = StaticFileServer().absoluteRootPath
    ```
   3. Add a Static File Server by adding the following to the `postInit()` function:  
    ```swift
    router.all(middleware: StaticFileServer())
    ```

    This will serve the contents of a directory, defaulting to the projects `/public` directory, as web pages.

2. Save the images to the StaticFileServer directory  
   Update the `storeHandler()` function to save the images to the directory the Static File Server is using by adding the following:
      ```swift
        let path = rootPath + "/" + meal.name + ".jpg"
        print("Writing file to: \(path)")
        fileManager.createFile(atPath: path, contents: meal.photo)
      ```

3. Create a `~/FoodTrackerBackend/FoodServer/public/jpeg.html` file containing just:
   ```
   <img src="Caprese Salad.jpg">
   ```

4. Re-build and re-run the server  
   Press the Run button or use the âŒ˜+R key shortcut.

3. Rerun the FoodTracker iOS App and view the Web App
   1. Run the iOS app in XCode and add or remove a Meal entry.  
   This is required to trigger a new save of the data to the server.
   2. Visit the web application to see the saved image at:  
   http://localhost:8080/jpeg.html
